simplicial: Simplicial topology in Python
=========================================

This package arose from explorations of using ideas from algebraic
topology in the context of wireless sensor networks, to tackle
problems like target tracking and estimation of the goodness-of-fit of
interpolations from isolated observations. Its main contribution is to
represent and manipulate simplicial complexes, topological structures
describing spaces built from cells.
