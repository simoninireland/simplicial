Acknowledgements
================

I'm grateful to Rob Ghrist for first getting me interested in this
stuff by showing its practical relationship with sensor networks
:cite:`BaryshnikovGhristEulerIntegrals`. I'm also massively indebted
to Jeremy Kun for his blog posts on computational homology, and
especially for providing code to back up his (excellent) mathematical
explanations :cite:`KunComputingHomology,KunComputingHomologyErrata`;
and similarly to Herbert Edelsbrunner, whose lecture
notes and code inspired much of the the current implementation of
homology :cite:`ComputationalTopology`.
