Acknowledgements
================

I'm grateful to Rob Ghrist for first getting me interested in this
stuff by showing its practical relationship with sensor networks. I'm
also massively indebted to Jeremy Kun for his blog posts on
computational homology, and especially for providing code to back up
his (excellent) mathematical explanations; and similarly to Herbert
Edelsbrunner, whose lecture notes and code inspired much of the the
current implementation of homology.
