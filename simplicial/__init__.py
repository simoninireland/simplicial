'''``simplicial`` is a Python package for manipulating simplicial
complexes.

Simplicial complexes are generalisations of the triangulation of a
plane. A :term:`complex` is built from simplices (singular:
:term:`simplex`), and can be used for a number of purposes: as
discrete approximations of continuous spaces or manifolds, or as
abstract descriptions of information relationships that can then be
explored and anlysed using techniques from algebraic :term:`topology`.

``simplicial`` provides a class :class:`SimplicialComplex` to
represents complexes and provide some topological operations. It also
provides some "standard" complexes, typically representatives of a
particularly structured class of spaces, that can be used as building
blocks for larger complexes. It also provides a function to "embed"
a complex into a space, which can be used for spatial computing and
for visualisation (although this still needs a lot more work).
