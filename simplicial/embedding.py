class Embedding:
    """The abstract embedding of a simplicial complex into a space. An
    embedding associates a position with each 0-simplex in the
    complex, allowing spatial calculations to be performed.

    Embeddings serve two distinct purposes. Firstly, they admit
    spatial calculations as well as purely topological ones, which
    broadens the application areas to which we can apply simplicial
    ideas. Secondly, embeddings form the basis for visualisation, as
    they allow points (0-simplices) in a complex to be associated with
    points in an n-dimensional embedding space. This can result in
    more meaingful diagrams.

    An embedding can be specified in two distinct ways. Positions can
    be supplied explicitly for simplices by name. Alternatively,
    sub-clases can provide positioning functions that map simplices to
    positions using arbitrary code. The former is useful for complexes
    with irregular embeddings, while the latter is better-suited to
    regular embeddings. Explicit positions override computed
    positions, which allows small distortions to be applied easily to
    otherwise regular embeddings.

    It is also possible to override the distance metric to construct
    different ways of metricating a space. The default is
    n-dimensional Euclidean.

    Note that in most cases an embedding is based on simplex names,
    and so care needs to be taken when relabeling simplices in the
    underlying complex.
